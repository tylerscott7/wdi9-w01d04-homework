// Problem 1
// 1. A parameter is a value that a function
//    receives in order to work correctly.
//
//    An argument is what the user inputs into
//    a method to have the method/function work
//    with their specific argument.
// 
// 2. Return will spit out a value within JavaScript
//    that the user can work with in their project whereas
//    console.log prints values to the console in order
//    to more efficiently troubleshoot problems.
//
// 3. Since a function can return a value, it allows your
//    code to be "DRY" because instead of trying to 
//    re-evaluate the same thing multiple times, you can
//    simply wrap the action in a function to call on.
